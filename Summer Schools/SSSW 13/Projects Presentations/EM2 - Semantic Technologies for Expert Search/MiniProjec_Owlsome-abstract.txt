Title: Semantic Technologies for Expert Search
Subtitle: We know the perfect job for you

Research in Data Mining and Semantic Web technologies has developed expressive and efficient tools for the extraction of semantics and patterns from large amounts of data. 
With the emergence and growing popularity of social networks, problems such as providing users with useful recommendations are more and more frequent.
In this paper we analyze such a problem by matching job recommendations based on user CV (for example for LinkedIn users).
Notably, we define the architecture of our system, which uses CP-Nets and similarity based on LOD technologies. Finally, we exemplify its practical utility.
